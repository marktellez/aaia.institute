# Profit Pipelines using Autonomous AI Agents in a Multi-Agent Framework
### A Research Grant Proposal

## Abstract

Our goal is to utilize AI advancements to identify and automate services and processes in the market, forcing market competition from AI for the first time. Once identified and automated, we can document it in the whitepaper, and use the time between researching and publishing of the research findings and methods to reward our investors/owners who have made the research

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Context
In the current technological landscape dominated by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the approaching horizon of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this research project aims to discover a "glitch in the matrix," a term we use to describe market inefficiencies or gaps that offer profitable opportunities. These inefficiencies will be exploited using Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agents (AAIAs), leveraging their capabilities to automate and monetize specific tasks or processes in various industries. In doing so, we will prove the reality of AAIAs replacing human labor on a large scale.


### 1.2 Problem Statement
As we stand on the cusp of major advancements in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agents (AAIAs), a glaring gap exists in the market: there are inefficiencies and tasks that can be automated and monetized, but have not yet been identified or exploited. While AGI and AAIAs have the potential to bring about significant economic benefits, there is currently no systematic approach to identify these market opportunities, prove the revenue-generating capabilities of AAIAs, or address the long-term impacts of their large-scale deployment. This project aims to fill this gap by leveraging AAIAs to discover, automate, and monetize such tasks and processes, thereby setting a precedent for AI-driven market competition. In doing so, we also confront the sociopolitical and economic challenges of human labor displacement.


### 1.3 Proposed Approach
To navigate the challenges and opportunities detailed in the Problem Statement, our approach is multi-pronged. We will begin by building a comprehensive framework that allows AAIAs to communicate and store long-term memory. This framework will enable the formation of small, autonomous teams of AAIAs capable of diverse communication and process patterns. These teams will then be deployed to identify market inefficiencies or tasks that can be automated and monetized.

After a period defined by a voted charter, we will publish a comprehensive whitepaper that outlines the methodologies, results, and implications of our research. During the interval between the research and the publication of the whitepaper, the revenue generated will be used to reward our investors and stakeholders, who hold our custom token.
